An array is a simple data structure used to store a collection of data in a contiguous block of memory.
Each element in the collection is accessed using an index, and the elements are easy to find because
they're stored sequentially in memory.
Because the collection of elements in an array is stored as a big block of data,
we typically use arrays when we know exactly how many pieces of data we're going to have.
For example, you might use an array to store a list of student ID numbers, or the names
of state capitals.
